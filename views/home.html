		Glasses, also known as eyeglasses or spectacles, are devices consisting of lenses mounted in a frame that holds them in front 
		of a person's eyes. Glasses are typically used for vision correction. Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying 
		debris or against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Sunglasses allow better vision in bright daylight, 
		and may protect one's eyes against damage from high levels of ultraviolet light.

		Safety glasses are worn to protect the eyes during a variety of tasks. They are made with shatter-resistant plastic lenses 
		to protect the eye from flying debris and can shield the eyes from hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. There 
		are also safety glasses for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in
		welding where a full sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called "flash goggles".
